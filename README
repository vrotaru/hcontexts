Contexts, can't do without them
===============================

1. In Java at least.
 
2. Pretty much every framework, I know of, offers to objects it instantiates and manages a context Object to save and retrieve atrributes needed at runtime. And almost invariably the keys to set/get the said attributes are plain strings. Which then need to be cast to their types.

3. This is project is an attempt to see if it would be handier to access those "Context Attributes" like this

	Property<FooBar> _foo = Context.propertyFor("foo", FooBar.class)
	FooBar foobar = context.get(_foo);

4. Properties can have default values.

5. In an attempt to make that data structure more universal, contexts implements the Iterable<Context> interface and you can do things like:

    Context item = outerContext.get(_item);
    for(Context currentItem: item) {
    	// do something with the currentItem
    }

5. It turned out that (and with a little twist) Contexts can be used to slurp in XML files with a simple XML.read(InputStream stream)
